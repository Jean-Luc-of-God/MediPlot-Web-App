# 🏥 MediPlot 3: Patient Health Visualization Dashboard

## 🎯 Project Overview

The **MediPlot 3 Patient Health Visualization Dashboard** is an academic project developed by a group from the Adventist University of Central Africa (AUCA) to transform critical care monitoring.

This system addresses the limitations of manual health monitoring and slow data interpretation by providing clinicians with **instant, interactive insights** into patient vital signs. The primary goal is to significantly accelerate diagnosis time and improve intervention responsiveness in critical care settings.

## ✨ Key Features and Objectives

* **Accelerated Diagnosis:** Provides a user-friendly interface that reduces the time required for physicians to interpret complex patient data.
* **Vital Sign Visualization:** Utilizes advanced Python libraries to visualize key physiological data, derived from a robust, simulated dataset of **100 virtual patients**.
* **High-Risk Outlier Detection:** Implements **Machine Learning (ML)** models to instantly flag and visualize patients exhibiting high-risk physiological patterns, enabling immediate focus on critical cases.
* **Clinical Correlation Confirmation:** Visually validates complex clinical hypotheses, such as confirming the link between **elevated heart rate and blood pressure**.
